This page will cover the basic operations of all the equipment at GPC, including operating the Camera, Music slideshow, and streaming.
For more in depth coverage, view the :ref:`software` page.

Slides
------

The Stream Deck comes with dedicated ← and → buttons that you'll use throughout the service to move between slides. Here's how they work:

* After loading your Sunday slideshow (check out :ref:`initial_freeshow`), simply use the ← and → buttons to move forward and backward through your presentation.

* When you reach the last slide of any element (like a song), you'll need to press the forward button twice to move on to the next item in your show. This double-press helps prevent accidental transitions between major sections.

.. note::
    See :ref:`software_streamdeck` for full information about the Stream Deck and it's buttons.
